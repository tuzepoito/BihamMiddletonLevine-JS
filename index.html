  This is a JavaScript implementation of the Biham-Middleton-Levine traffic model, a self-organizaing cellular
  automaton.<br />
  There are two types of pixels, or "cars": red cars, which can only move to the right, and blue cars, which can only
  move to the bottom.<br />
  At each step, a car may only advance if the pixel in front is not occupied by another car.<br />
  You can adjust the density (initial ratio of car pixels over total number of pixels) with the slider. If you change
  the density, the automaton will be reinitialized.<br />
  The result may change drastically depending on the initial density. Naturally, high values will result in the traffic
  eventually going into a "jammed" state. Some values provide interesting results.<br />
  While the base rules are simple, the behaviour that derives may prove to become complex and has been a subject of
  study. Check the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biham%E2%80%93Middleton%E2%80%93Levine_traffic_model">Wikipedia
  page</a> for more information.<br />
